# Instructions for Data Scientist Assessment Test:

# Exercise: Building a credit risk model 

This exercise requires you to come up with the most optimal statistical model for predicting the creditworthiness (‘Response’ variable in modeling.txt). After this, explain your exploratory analyses, intermediate steps and final model selection, as you would to a non-statistician business user that wants to understand the core drivers of creditability in a short write up of not more than 1200 words.
Statistical comments and justifications of specific statistical techniques you chose should be given in the comments of your code. The audience for these comments is looking to understand the details of why you did what you did. Please share your R code or Python code (please use python 3.x, if you intend to work in Python) named as modeling.R or modeling.py
Please feel free to make reasonable assumptions, do basic analyses, if any, but ensure that you mention them in the final report. If you deem fit, you can create and use your own derived variables and use them for the modeling. You are required to check for the model diagnostics and predictive accuracy measure(s) and report them.
Please refrain from using any existing solution available on internet as any evidence of this will result in immediate disqualification from all job postings in the Data Science team. 

# Attachments – 
•	ModelingData.txt – Please use this dataset for model building and testing purposes.
•	ModelingCodeBook.xlsx – This would provide the variable names and their descriptions

# Assessment

Your solution will be assessed based on:
